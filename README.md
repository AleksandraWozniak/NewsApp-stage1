# NewsApp-stage1

News app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. It was written in Java and Android.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills, using Guardian API. They include:
•	Connecting to an API
•	Parsing the JSON response
•	Handling error cases gracefully
•	Updating information regularly
•	Using an AsyncTask
•	Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle

This is just a practice app for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships">Google Developer Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics</a> I received for the Android Basics path (Udacity courses ud836/nd803).
